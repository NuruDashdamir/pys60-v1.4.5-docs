2 PEPs 252 and 253: Type and Class Changes</A>
</H1>

<P>
The largest and most far-reaching changes in Python 2.2 are to
Python's model of objects and classes.  The changes should be backward
compatible, so it's likely that your code will continue to run
unchanged, but the changes provide some amazing new capabilities.
Before beginning this, the longest and most complicated section of
this article, I'll provide an overview of the changes and offer some
comments.

<P>
A long time ago I wrote a Web page
(<a class="url" href="http://www.amk.ca/python/writing/warts.html">http://www.amk.ca/python/writing/warts.html</a>) listing flaws in
Python's design.  One of the most significant flaws was that it's
impossible to subclass Python types implemented in C.  In particular,
it's not possible to subclass built-in types, so you can't just
subclass, say, lists in order to add a single useful method to them.
The <tt class="module">UserList</tt> module provides a class that supports all of the
methods of lists and that can be subclassed further, but there's lots
of C code that expects a regular Python list and won't accept a
<tt class="class">UserList</tt> instance.

<P>
Python 2.2 fixes this, and in the process adds some exciting new
capabilities.  A brief summary:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>You can subclass built-in types such as lists and even integers,
and your subclasses should work in every place that requires the
original type.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>It's now possible to define static and class methods, in addition
to the instance methods available in previous versions of Python.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>It's also possible to automatically call methods on accessing or
setting an instance attribute by using a new mechanism called
<i class="dfn">properties</i>.  Many uses of <tt class="method">__getattr__</tt> can be rewritten
to use properties instead, making the resulting code simpler and
faster.  As a small side benefit, attributes can now have docstrings,
too.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The list of legal attributes for an instance can be limited to a
particular set using <i class="dfn">slots</i>, making it possible to safeguard
against typos and perhaps make more optimizations possible in future
versions of Python.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Some users have voiced concern about all these changes.  Sure, they
say, the new features are neat and lend themselves to all sorts of
tricks that weren't possible in previous versions of Python, but
they also make the language more complicated.  Some people have said
that they've always recommended Python for its simplicity, and feel
that its simplicity is being lost.

<P>
Personally, I think there's no need to worry.  Many of the new
features are quite esoteric, and you can write a lot of Python code
without ever needed to be aware of them.  Writing a simple class is no
more difficult than it ever was, so you don't need to bother learning
or teaching them unless they're actually needed.  Some very
complicated tasks that were previously only possible from C will now
be possible in pure Python, and to my mind that's all for the better.

<P>
I'm not going to attempt to cover every single corner case and small
change that were required to make the new features work.  Instead this
section will paint only the broad strokes.  See section&nbsp;<A href="sect-rellinks.html#sect-rellinks">2.5</A>,
``Related Links'', for further sources of information about Python 2.2's new
object model.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000310000000000000000">
2.1 Old and New Classes</A>
</H2>

<P>
First, you should know that Python 2.2 really has two kinds of
classes: classic or old-style classes, and new-style classes.  The
old-style class model is exactly the same as the class model in
earlier versions of Python.  All the new features described in this
section apply only to new-style classes. This divergence isn't
intended to last forever; eventually old-style classes will be
dropped, possibly in Python 3.0.

<P>
So how do you define a new-style class?  You do it by subclassing an
existing new-style class.  Most of Python's built-in types, such as
integers, lists, dictionaries, and even files, are new-style classes
now.  A new-style class named <tt class="class">object</tt>, the base class for all
built-in types, has been also been added so if no built-in type is
suitable, you can just subclass <tt class="class">object</tt>:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
class C(object):
    def __init__ (self):
        ...
    ...
</pre></dl>

<P>
This means that <tt class="keyword">class</tt> statements that don't have any base
classes are always classic classes in Python 2.2.  (Actually you can
also change this by setting a module-level variable named
<tt class="member">__metaclass__</tt> -- see <a class="rfc" name="rfcref-1147"
href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0253.html">PEP 253</a> for the details -- but it's
easier to just subclass <tt class="keyword">object</tt>.)

<P>
The type objects for the built-in types are available as built-ins,
named using a clever trick.  Python has always had built-in functions
named <tt class="function">int()</tt>, <tt class="function">float()</tt>, and <tt class="function">str()</tt>.  In
2.2, they aren't functions any more, but type objects that behave as
factories when called.

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
&gt;&gt;&gt; int
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; int('123')
123
</pre></dl>

<P>
To make the set of types complete, new type objects such as
<tt class="function">dict</tt> and <tt class="function">file</tt> have been added.  Here's a
more interesting example, adding a <tt class="method">lock()</tt> method to file
objects:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
class LockableFile(file):
    def lock (self, operation, length=0, start=0, whence=0):
        import fcntl
        return fcntl.lockf(self.fileno(), operation,
                           length, start, whence)
</pre></dl>

<P>
The now-obsolete <tt class="module">posixfile</tt> module contained a class that
emulated all of a file object's methods and also added a
<tt class="method">lock()</tt> method, but this class couldn't be passed to internal
functions that expected a built-in file, something which is possible
with our new <tt class="class">LockableFile</tt>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000320000000000000000">
2.2 Descriptors</A>
</H2>

<P>
In previous versions of Python, there was no consistent way to
discover what attributes and methods were supported by an object.
There were some informal conventions, such as defining
<tt class="member">__members__</tt> and <tt class="member">__methods__</tt> attributes that were
lists of names, but often the author of an extension type or a class
wouldn't bother to define them.  You could fall back on inspecting the
<tt class="member">__dict__</tt> of an object, but when class inheritance or an
arbitrary <tt class="method">__getattr__</tt> hook were in use this could still be
inaccurate.

<P>
The one big idea underlying the new class model is that an API for
describing the attributes of an object using <i class="dfn">descriptors</i> has
been formalized.  Descriptors specify the value of an attribute,
stating whether it's a method or a field.  With the descriptor API,
static methods and class methods become possible, as well as more
exotic constructs.

<P>
Attribute descriptors are objects that live inside class objects, and
have a few attributes of their own:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><tt class="member">__name__</tt> is the attribute's name.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><tt class="member">__doc__</tt> is the attribute's docstring.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><tt class="method">__get__(<var>object</var>)</tt> is a method that retrieves the
attribute value from <var>object</var>. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI><tt class="method">__set__(<var>object</var>, <var>value</var>)</tt> sets the attribute
on <var>object</var> to <var>value</var>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><tt class="method">__delete__(<var>object</var>, <var>value</var>)</tt> deletes the <var>value</var> 
attribute of <var>object</var>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For example, when you write <code>obj.x</code>, the steps that Python
actually performs are:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
descriptor = obj.__class__.x
descriptor.__get__(obj)
</pre></dl>

<P>
For methods, <tt class="method">descriptor.__get__</tt> returns a temporary object that's
callable, and wraps up the instance and the method to be called on it.
This is also why static methods and class methods are now possible;
they have descriptors that wrap up just the method, or the method and
the class.  As a brief explanation of these new kinds of methods,
static methods aren't passed the instance, and therefore resemble
regular functions.  Class methods are passed the class of the object,
but not the object itself.  Static and class methods are defined like
this:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
class C(object):
    def f(arg1, arg2):
        ...
    f = staticmethod(f)

    def g(cls, arg1, arg2):
        ...
    g = classmethod(g)
</pre></dl>

<P>
The <tt class="function">staticmethod()</tt> function takes the function
<tt class="function">f</tt>, and returns it wrapped up in a descriptor so it can be
stored in the class object.  You might expect there to be special
syntax for creating such methods (<code>def static f()</code>,
<code>defstatic f()</code>, or something like that) but no such syntax has
been defined yet; that's been left for future versions of Python.

<P>
More new features, such as slots and properties, are also implemented
as new kinds of descriptors, and it's not difficult to write a
descriptor class that does something novel.  For example, it would be
possible to write a descriptor class that made it possible to write
Eiffel-style preconditions and postconditions for a method.  A class
that used this feature might be defined like this:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
from eiffel import eiffelmethod

class C(object):
    def f(self, arg1, arg2):
        # The actual function
        ...
    def pre_f(self):
        # Check preconditions
        ...
    def post_f(self):
        # Check postconditions
        ...

    f = eiffelmethod(f, pre_f, post_f)
</pre></dl>

<P>
Note that a person using the new <tt class="function">eiffelmethod()</tt> doesn't
have to understand anything about descriptors.  This is why I think
the new features don't increase the basic complexity of the language.
There will be a few wizards who need to know about it in order to
write <tt class="function">eiffelmethod()</tt> or the ZODB or whatever, but most
users will just write code on top of the resulting libraries and
ignore the implementation details.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000330000000000000000">
2.3 Multiple Inheritance: The Diamond Rule</A>
</H2>

<P>
Multiple inheritance has also been made more useful through changing
the rules under which names are resolved.  Consider this set of classes
(diagram taken from <a class="rfc" name="rfcref-1151"
href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0253.html">PEP 253</a> by Guido van Rossum):

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
                class A:
                  ^ ^  def save(self): ...
                 /   \
                /     \
               /       \
              /         \
          class B     class C:
              ^         ^  def save(self): ...
               \       /
                \     /
                 \   /
                  \ /
                class D
</pre></dl>

<P>
The lookup rule for classic classes is simple but not very smart; the
base classes are searched depth-first, going from left to right.  A
reference to <tt class="method">D.save</tt> will search the classes <tt class="class">D</tt>,
<tt class="class">B</tt>, and then <tt class="class">A</tt>, where <tt class="method">save()</tt> would be found
and returned.  <tt class="method">C.save()</tt> would never be found at all.  This is
bad, because if <tt class="class">C</tt>'s <tt class="method">save()</tt> method is saving some
internal state specific to <tt class="class">C</tt>, not calling it will result in
that state never getting saved.

<P>
New-style classes follow a different algorithm that's a bit more
complicated to explain, but does the right thing in this situation.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>List all the base classes, following the classic lookup rule and
include a class multiple times if it's visited repeatedly.  In the
above example, the list of visited classes is [<tt class="class">D</tt>, <tt class="class">B</tt>,
<tt class="class">A</tt>, <tt class="class">C</tt>, <tt class="class">A</tt>].

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Scan the list for duplicated classes.  If any are found, remove
all but one occurrence, leaving the <i>last</i> one in the list.  In
the above example, the list becomes [<tt class="class">D</tt>, <tt class="class">B</tt>, <tt class="class">C</tt>,
<tt class="class">A</tt>] after dropping duplicates.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Following this rule, referring to <tt class="method">D.save()</tt> will return
<tt class="method">C.save()</tt>, which is the behaviour we're after.  This lookup
rule is the same as the one followed by Common Lisp.  A new built-in
function, <tt class="function">super()</tt>, provides a way to get at a class's
superclasses without having to reimplement Python's algorithm.
The most commonly used form will be 
<tt class="function">super(<var>class</var>, <var>obj</var>)</tt>, which returns 
a bound superclass object (not the actual class object).  This form
will be used in methods to call a method in the superclass; for
example, <tt class="class">D</tt>'s <tt class="method">save()</tt> method would look like this:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
class D:
    def save (self):
	# Call superclass .save()
        super(D, self).save()
        # Save D's private information here
        ...
</pre></dl>

<P>
<tt class="function">super()</tt> can also return unbound superclass objects
when called as <tt class="function">super(<var>class</var>)</tt> or
<tt class="function">super(<var>class1</var>, <var>class2</var>)</tt>, but this probably won't
often be useful.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000340000000000000000">
2.4 Attribute Access</A>
</H2>

<P>
A fair number of sophisticated Python classes define hooks for
attribute access using <tt class="method">__getattr__</tt>; most commonly this is
done for convenience, to make code more readable by automatically
mapping an attribute access such as <code>obj.parent</code> into a method
call such as <code>obj.get_parent()</code>.  Python 2.2 adds some new ways
of controlling attribute access.

<P>
First, <tt class="method">__getattr__(<var>attr_name</var>)</tt> is still supported by
new-style classes, and nothing about it has changed.  As before, it
will be called when an attempt is made to access <code>obj.foo</code> and no
attribute named "<tt class="samp">foo</tt>" is found in the instance's dictionary.

<P>
New-style classes also support a new method,
<tt class="method">__getattribute__(<var>attr_name</var>)</tt>.  The difference between
the two methods is that <tt class="method">__getattribute__</tt> is <i>always</i>
called whenever any attribute is accessed, while the old
<tt class="method">__getattr__</tt> is only called if "<tt class="samp">foo</tt>" isn't found in the
instance's dictionary.

<P>
However, Python 2.2's support for <i class="dfn">properties</i> will often be a
simpler way to trap attribute references.  Writing a
<tt class="method">__getattr__</tt> method is complicated because to avoid recursion
you can't use regular attribute accesses inside them, and instead have
to mess around with the contents of <tt class="member">__dict__</tt>.
<tt class="method">__getattr__</tt> methods also end up being called by Python when
it checks for other methods such as <tt class="method">__repr__</tt> or
<tt class="method">__coerce__</tt>, and so have to be written with this in mind.
Finally, calling a function on every attribute access results in a
sizable performance loss.

<P>
<tt class="class">property</tt> is a new built-in type that packages up three
functions that get, set, or delete an attribute, and a docstring.  For
example, if you want to define a <tt class="member">size</tt> attribute that's
computed, but also settable, you could write:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
class C(object):
    def get_size (self):
        result = ... computation ...
        return result
    def set_size (self, size):
        ... compute something based on the size
        and set internal state appropriately ...

    # Define a property.  The 'delete this attribute'
    # method is defined as None, so the attribute
    # can't be deleted.
    size = property(get_size, set_size,
                    None,
                    "Storage size of this instance")
</pre></dl>

<P>
That is certainly clearer and easier to write than a pair of
<tt class="method">__getattr__</tt>/<tt class="method">__setattr__</tt> methods that check for the
<tt class="member">size</tt> attribute and handle it specially while retrieving all
other attributes from the instance's <tt class="member">__dict__</tt>.  Accesses to
<tt class="member">size</tt> are also the only ones which have to perform the work of
calling a function, so references to other attributes run at
their usual speed.

<P>
Finally, it's possible to constrain the list of attributes that can be
referenced on an object using the new <tt class="member">__slots__</tt> class attribute.
Python objects are usually very dynamic; at any time it's possible to
define a new attribute on an instance by just doing
<code>obj.new_attr=1</code>.  This is flexible and convenient, but this
flexibility can also lead to bugs, as when you meant to write
<code>obj.template = 'a'</code> but made a typo and wrote
<code>obj.templtae</code> by accident.  

<P>
A new-style class can define a class attribute named <tt class="member">__slots__</tt>
to constrain the list of legal attribute names.  An example will make
this clear:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...     __slots__ = ('template', 'name')
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; obj = C()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print obj.template
None
&gt;&gt;&gt; obj.template = 'Test'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print obj.template
Test
&gt;&gt;&gt; obj.templtae = None
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
AttributeError: 'C' object has no attribute 'templtae'
</pre></dl>

<P>
Note how you get an <tt class="exception">AttributeError</tt> on the attempt to
assign to an attribute not listed in <tt class="member">__slots__</tt>.

2.5 Related Links
</H2>

<P>
This section has just been a quick overview of the new features,
giving enough of an explanation to start you programming, but many
details have been simplified or ignored.  Where should you go to get a
more complete picture?

<P>
<a class="url" href="http://www.python.org/2.2/descrintro.html">http://www.python.org/2.2/descrintro.html</a> is a lengthy tutorial
introduction to the descriptor features, written by Guido van Rossum.
If my description has whetted your appetite, go read this tutorial
next, because it goes into much more detail about the new features
while still remaining quite easy to read.

<P>
Next, there are two relevant PEPs, <a class="rfc" name="rfcref-1155"
href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0252.html">PEP 252</a> and <a class="rfc" name="rfcref-1157"
href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0253.html">PEP 253</a>.  <a class="rfc" name="rfcref-1159"
href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0252.html">PEP 252</a>
is titled "Making Types Look More Like Classes", and covers the
descriptor API.  <a class="rfc" name="rfcref-1161"
href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0253.html">PEP 253</a> is titled "Subtyping Built-in Types", and
describes the changes to type objects that make it possible to subtype
built-in objects.  <a class="rfc" name="rfcref-1163"
href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0253.html">PEP 253</a> is the more complicated PEP of the two,
and at a few points the necessary explanations of types and meta-types
may cause your head to explode.  Both PEPs were written and
implemented by Guido van Rossum, with substantial assistance from the
rest of the Zope Corp. team.

<P>
Finally, there's the ultimate authority: the source code.  Most of the
machinery for the type handling is in <span class="file">Objects/typeobject.c</span>, but
you should only resort to it after all other avenues have been
exhausted, including posting a question to python-list or python-dev.
