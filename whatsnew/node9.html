<H1><A NAME="SECTION000900000000000000000">
8 PEP 227: Nested Scopes</A>
</H1>

<P>
In Python 2.1, statically nested scopes were added as an optional
feature, to be enabled by a <code>from __future__ import
nested_scopes</code> directive.  In 2.2 nested scopes no longer need to be
specially enabled, and are now always present.  The rest of this section
is a copy of the description of nested scopes from my ``What's New in
Python 2.1'' document; if you read it when 2.1 came out, you can skip
the rest of this section.

<P>
The largest change introduced in Python 2.1, and made complete in 2.2,
is to Python's scoping rules.  In Python 2.0, at any given time there
are at most three namespaces used to look up variable names: local,
module-level, and the built-in namespace.  This often surprised people
because it didn't match their intuitive expectations.  For example, a
nested recursive function definition doesn't work:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
def f():
    ...
    def g(value):
        ...
        return g(value-1) + 1
    ...
</pre></dl>

<P>
The function <tt class="function">g()</tt> will always raise a <tt class="exception">NameError</tt>
exception, because the binding of the name "<tt class="samp">g</tt>" isn't in either
its local namespace or in the module-level namespace.  This isn't much
of a problem in practice (how often do you recursively define interior
functions like this?), but this also made using the <tt class="keyword">lambda</tt>
statement clumsier, and this was a problem in practice.  In code which
uses <tt class="keyword">lambda</tt> you can often find local variables being copied
by passing them as the default values of arguments.

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
def find(self, name):
    "Return list of any entries equal to 'name'"
    L = filter(lambda x, name=name: x == name,
               self.list_attribute)
    return L
</pre></dl>

<P>
The readability of Python code written in a strongly functional style
suffers greatly as a result.

<P>
The most significant change to Python 2.2 is that static scoping has
been added to the language to fix this problem.  As a first effect,
the <code>name=name</code> default argument is now unnecessary in the above
example.  Put simply, when a given variable name is not assigned a
value within a function (by an assignment, or the <tt class="keyword">def</tt>,
<tt class="keyword">class</tt>, or <tt class="keyword">import</tt> statements), references to the
variable will be looked up in the local namespace of the enclosing
scope.  A more detailed explanation of the rules, and a dissection of
the implementation, can be found in the PEP.

<P>
This change may cause some compatibility problems for code where the
same variable name is used both at the module level and as a local
variable within a function that contains further function definitions.
This seems rather unlikely though, since such code would have been
pretty confusing to read in the first place.  

<P>
One side effect of the change is that the <code>from <var>module</var>
import *</code> and <tt class="keyword">exec</tt> statements have been made illegal inside
a function scope under certain conditions.  The Python reference
manual has said all along that <code>from <var>module</var> import *</code> is
only legal at the top level of a module, but the CPython interpreter
has never enforced this before.  As part of the implementation of
nested scopes, the compiler which turns Python source into bytecodes
has to generate different code to access variables in a containing
scope.  <code>from <var>module</var> import *</code> and <tt class="keyword">exec</tt> make it
impossible for the compiler to figure this out, because they add names
to the local namespace that are unknowable at compile time.
Therefore, if a function contains function definitions or
<tt class="keyword">lambda</tt> expressions with free variables, the compiler will
flag this by raising a <tt class="exception">SyntaxError</tt> exception.

<P>
To make the preceding explanation a bit clearer, here's an example:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
x = 1
def f():
    # The next line is a syntax error
    exec 'x=2'  
    def g():
        return x
</pre></dl>

<P>
Line 4 containing the <tt class="keyword">exec</tt> statement is a syntax error,
since <tt class="keyword">exec</tt> would define a new local variable named "<tt class="samp">x</tt>"whose value should be accessed by <tt class="function">g()</tt>.  

<P>
This shouldn't be much of a limitation, since <tt class="keyword">exec</tt> is rarely
used in most Python code (and when it is used, it's often a sign of a
poor design anyway).
