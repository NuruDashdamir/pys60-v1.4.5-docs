11 Other Changes and Fixes</A>
</H1>

<P>
As usual there were a bunch of other improvements and bugfixes
scattered throughout the source tree.  A search through the CVS change
logs finds there were 527 patches applied, and 683 bugs fixed; both
figures are likely to be underestimates.  Some of the more notable
changes are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The code for the MacOS port for Python, maintained by Jack
  Jansen, is now kept in the main Python CVS tree, and many changes
  have been made to support MacOS&nbsp;X.

<P>
The most significant change is the ability to build Python as a
framework, enabled by supplying the <b class="programopt">--enable-framework</b>
option to the configure script when compiling Python.  According to
Jack Jansen, ``This installs a self-contained Python installation plus
the OS&nbsp;X framework "glue" into
<span class="file">/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework</span> (or another location of
choice).  For now there is little immediate added benefit to this
(actually, there is the disadvantage that you have to change your PATH
to be able to find Python), but it is the basis for creating a
full-blown Python application, porting the MacPython IDE, possibly
using Python as a standard OSA scripting language and much more.''

<P>
Most of the MacPython toolbox modules, which interface to MacOS APIs
such as windowing, QuickTime, scripting, etc. have been ported to OS&nbsp;X,
but they've been left commented out in <span class="file">setup.py</span>.  People who want
to experiment with these modules can uncomment them manually.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Keyword arguments passed to builtin functions that don't take them
  now cause a <tt class="exception">TypeError</tt> exception to be raised, with the
  message "<var>function</var> takes no keyword arguments".

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Weak references, added in Python 2.1 as an extension module,
  are now part of the core because they're used in the implementation
  of new-style classes.  The <tt class="exception">ReferenceError</tt> exception has
  therefore moved from the <tt class="module">weakref</tt> module to become a
  built-in exception.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A new script, <span class="file">Tools/scripts/cleanfuture.py</span> by Tim
  Peters, automatically removes obsolete <code>__future__</code> statements
  from Python source code.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>An additional <var>flags</var> argument has been added to the
  built-in function <tt class="function">compile()</tt>, so the behaviour of
  <code>__future__</code> statements can now be correctly observed in
  simulated shells, such as those presented by IDLE and other
  development environments.  This is described in <a class="rfc" name="rfcref-1195"
href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0264.html">PEP 264</a>.
  (Contributed by Michael Hudson.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The new license introduced with Python 1.6 wasn't
  GPL-compatible.  This is fixed by some minor textual changes to the
  2.2 license, so it's now legal to embed Python inside a GPLed
  program again.  Note that Python itself is not GPLed, but instead is
  under a license that's essentially equivalent to the BSD license,
  same as it always was.  The license changes were also applied to the
  Python 2.0.1 and 2.1.1 releases.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When presented with a Unicode filename on Windows, Python will
  now convert it to an MBCS encoded string, as used by the Microsoft
  file APIs.  As MBCS is explicitly used by the file APIs, Python's
  choice of ASCII as the default encoding turns out to be an
  annoyance.  On Unix, the locale's character set is used if
  <tt class="function">locale.nl_langinfo(CODESET)</tt> is available.  (Windows
  support was contributed by Mark Hammond with assistance from
  Marc-Andr&#233; Lemburg. Unix support was added by Martin von L&#246;wis.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Large file support is now enabled on Windows.  (Contributed by
  Tim Peters.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <span class="file">Tools/scripts/ftpmirror.py</span> script
  now parses a <span class="file">.netrc</span> file, if you have one.
  (Contributed by Mike Romberg.) 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Some features of the object returned by the
  <tt class="function">xrange()</tt> function are now deprecated, and trigger
  warnings when they're accessed; they'll disappear in Python 2.3.
  <tt class="class">xrange</tt> objects tried to pretend they were full sequence
  types by supporting slicing, sequence multiplication, and the
  <tt class="keyword">in</tt> operator, but these features were rarely used and
  therefore buggy.  The <tt class="method">tolist()</tt> method and the
  <tt class="member">start</tt>, <tt class="member">stop</tt>, and <tt class="member">step</tt> attributes are also
  being deprecated.  At the C level, the fourth argument to the
  <tt class="cfunction">PyRange_New()</tt> function, "<tt class="samp">repeat</tt>", has also been
  deprecated.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>There were a bunch of patches to the dictionary
  implementation, mostly to fix potential core dumps if a dictionary
  contains objects that sneakily changed their hash value, or mutated
  the dictionary they were contained in. For a while python-dev fell
  into a gentle rhythm of Michael Hudson finding a case that dumped
  core, Tim Peters fixing the bug, Michael finding another case, and round
  and round it went.   

<P>
</LI>
<LI>On Windows, Python can now be compiled with Borland C thanks
  to a number of patches contributed by Stephen Hansen, though the
  result isn't fully functional yet.  (But this <i>is</i> progress...)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Another Windows enhancement: Wise Solutions generously offered
  PythonLabs use of their InstallerMaster 8.1 system.  Earlier
  PythonLabs Windows installers used Wise 5.0a, which was beginning to
  show its age.  (Packaged up by Tim Peters.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Files ending in "<tt class="samp">.pyw</tt>" can now be imported on Windows.
  "<tt class="samp">.pyw</tt>" is a Windows-only thing, used to indicate that a script
  needs to be run using PYTHONW.EXE instead of PYTHON.EXE in order to
  prevent a DOS console from popping up to display the output.  This
  patch makes it possible to import such scripts, in case they're also
  usable as modules.  (Implemented by David Bolen.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>On platforms where Python uses the C <tt class="cfunction">dlopen()</tt> function 
  to load extension modules, it's now possible to set the flags used 
  by <tt class="cfunction">dlopen()</tt> using the <tt class="function">sys.getdlopenflags()</tt> and
  <tt class="function">sys.setdlopenflags()</tt> functions.    (Contributed by Bram Stolk.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <tt class="function">pow()</tt> built-in function no longer supports 3
  arguments when floating-point numbers are supplied.
  <code>pow(<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, <var>z</var>)</code> returns <code>(x**y) % z</code>, but
  this is never useful for floating point numbers, and the final
  result varies unpredictably depending on the platform.  A call such
  as <code>pow(2.0, 8.0, 7.0)</code> will now raise a <tt class="exception">TypeError</tt>
  exception.

<P>
